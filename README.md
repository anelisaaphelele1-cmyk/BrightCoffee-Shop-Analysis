# BrightCoffee-Shop-Analysis
**BrightCoffee-Shop-Analysis**
A comprehensive, data-driven exploration of coffee sales performance, quality, and roasting characteristics using SQL. This repository presents an in-depth analysis of sales data from a coffee shop chain operating across three branches, covering transactions from January to the present. The project uncovers performance patterns, customer preferences, and product-level insights through data analytics and visualization.

Project Summary

This case study focused on analyzing coffee quality data to understand how different factors such as bean origin, roast level, processing method, and physical characteristics—impact overall taste scores. The dataset was cleaned, explored, and transformed to reveal patterns that influence the quality of coffee beans.

1. How the Case Study Was Done & Insights Found

The analysis was carried out by performing data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and statistical evaluation:

SQL was used to clean and structure the dataset, remove duplicates, standardize variables, and prepare the data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to uncover patterns between roast variables, origin, bean characteristics, and taste scores.

Visualizations were created to compare attributes such as origin vs. taste score, roast level vs. acidity, and processing method vs. flavour profile.

Statistical insights were derived to determine which variables most strongly influence cup scores.

Key Insights:

Certain origins consistently produced higher cup scores, especially regions known for high-altitude cultivation.

Beans processed using specific methods  showed distinct differences in taste and aroma.

Roast level played a notable role in body, acidity, and aftertaste scores.

Bean attributes such as moisture content and defect count correlated with sensory results.

2. Summary of What Was Done & What Was Found

In summary, the project cleaned and analyzed coffee quality data to identify the main factors that shape taste scores. The findings show that origin, bean processing method, and roast level are strong indicators of overall coffee quality. Visual and statistical analysis confirmed clear relationships between physical bean characteristics and final cup scores.
